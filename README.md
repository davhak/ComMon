# COM Monitor
A Windows GUI application to provide convenient and intuitive serial port interaction. 

## Description
In addition to various serial port configuration settings that are nowdays common to all such applications which interact with serial ports, COM Monitor offers two modes to work with a port. 

These are, Single and Loop modes. 

In Single mode the user interacts with a port in the most simple way by receiving data in terminal and sending bytes by typing. 

In Loop mode it is possible to send a given string (ASCII or hexadecimal) iteratively for a fixed or infinite number of times (with a delay between the sends).

Furthermore, it is possible to send data from a file (with optional manipulation of data before sending) as well as log all the traffic. 

COM Monitor also lets to capture certain frame. This is useful when there is lots of incoming data and occurance of only a certain frame is of interest. 

## Installation

COM Monitor does not require installation. Simply, extract the ZIP file to a desired folder and run the executable.
